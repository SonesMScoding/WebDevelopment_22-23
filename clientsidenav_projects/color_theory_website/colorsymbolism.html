                <p><b>Orange</b>- Energy, Happiness, Vitality. Orange is associated with the changing of seasons quite often. Orange demands your attention or you will miss the leaves change.</p>
                <p><b>Yellow</b>- Happiness, Hope, Deceit. Yellow catches our eyes more than any other. While yellow can be an energetic, cheerful color... it is also the color of hazmat suits and traffic yields.</p>
                <p><b>Green</b>- New Beginnings, Abundance, Nature. Green is a very grounded color. It is a very stable color and can balance a design. It's shade has a major impact on the design as well. Think about all the different kinds of green!</p>

                <p><b>Black</b>- Mystery, Elegance, Evil. Black is a strong neutral color mostly used for accents, but it's cultural weight is stronger than theory.</p>
