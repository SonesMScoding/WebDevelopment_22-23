AESTHETIC BOARD SITE!!!
Notes: 
*** currently does not display the picture for the color that is described and
chosen with a form with radio buttons 

*** the whole background of the website and the text turning an appropriate color
would be neat 


COLOR SYMBOLISM SITE !!!
notes:
 *** boring

 CONTACT SITE !!!
 notes:
 *** boring 

 *** maybe some form that contacts through the site:
    https://www.aspsnippets.com/Articles/Get-multiple-selected-checked-CheckBox-values-in-Array-using-JavaScript.aspx
    add a text area box, multiple selection checkbox which selections are put in arrays

    when the submit button is hit a page loads that tells the reader the form was submitted. 
    
    !!!LOOK RIGHT HERE 4/4/2023 !!!The page and function works and tells the thing is submitted. 

    ADD 5 more options and turn the dropdown into a checkbox that can select multiple.
        ^^ the selection values will go into an array using js most likely
