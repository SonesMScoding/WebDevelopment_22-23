    <h2>Where it All Starts: The Color Wheel</h2>
</header>
    <main>
        <p>The color wheel is made up of three primary colors, three secondary colors, and six tertiary colors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Primary Color - Red, blue, yellow. These are the base of the color wheel. All other colors can be made using these colors.(other than magenta, I will make a page on magenta one day)</p>
        <p>Secondary Color - Created by mixing two primary colors, there are three colors that can be produces. Purple, green, and orange are the secondary colors.</p>
        <p>Tertiary Color - Each of these six colors, are combinations of primary colors and secondary colors. Red-orange, red-purple, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green, and blue-purple are the in between colors in the color wheel. </p>
       <br>
        <p>Designers and artists get deep into the color wheel and really mess it up to create all the diverse visuals we have today. </p>
        <p>Color theory reminds creatives that there are some combinations and practices that assist in consistently pleasing aesthetics.</p>
